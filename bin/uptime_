# UPTIME is an instance of class datetime.time instead of

# datetime.datetime equals respectively 1, 1 and 1 - which means that if
# we would made UPTIME an instance of class datetime.datetime, mentioned
# attributes would not correspond to the actual values; e.g. uptime of 0
# days would equal value 1 of datetime.datetime.day.
# The issue does not apply to the time portion of datetime.datetime,
# which is extracted by the datetime.datetime.time method to limit the
# possibility of wrong use.
# This solution limits the functionality, too (it is not possible to
# extract information about how long the machine is up in days), but it
# could be easily solved by the direct use of datetime.timedelta.
