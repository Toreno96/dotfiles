VERSION=2.3.0

USAGE=$(cat << EOF
Usage: $(basename "${0}") [-hvpP] PACKAGE_MANAGER FRONTEND

Pretty-print a number of outdated packages per number of installed packages for
PACKAGE_MANAGER, with the result compatible with FRONTEND.

Mainly intended for use in all sorts of status bars.

Options:
  -h       Show this help message and exit
  -v       Show version information and exit
  -p / -P  Include/exclude pinned packages when evaluating outdated packages;
           option -p is ignored (forced to -P) if PACKAGE_MANAGER equals to
           \`pacman\` due to technical limitations
           [default: P if PACKAGE_MANAGER is \`pacman\`, p otherwise]

Supported values for PACKAGE_MANAGER:
  brew     The Homebrew package manager for macOS (or Linux)
           https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage
           Requires installed:
           - brew
  pacman   The pacman package manager for Arch Linux
           https://man.archlinux.org/man/pacman.8
           Requires installed:
           - pacman
           - checkupdates
           - checkupdates-aur

Supported values for FRONTEND:
  tmux     The result must be compatible with the status line of tmux terminal
           multiplexer
           https://github.com/tmux/tmux
  xfce     The result must be compatible with the XFCE4 Genmon plugin
           https://docs.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin
