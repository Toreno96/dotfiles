# After connecting my Keychron K14 (or any physical keyboard, I guess) to
# Android phone, I'm not able to input typographical characters like em dash,
# ellipsis, etc. There's no built-in shortcut for that, neither I have access to
# Compose key, as opposed to my macOS/Linux configuration.
#
# As a workaround, I type ASCII approximate[^1] of those typographical
# characters, and then I replace them on a machine where I can input them. This
# script automates the last part of the workaround. Also, it's possible to use
# it on Termux at Android, so that way I don't even need to send the file to
# another machine.
#
# [^1]: as defined by myself: they are either inspired by Compose key sequences,
#       like `---` (triple hyphen) for em dash, or invented myself, like `,,` double
#       comma and `''` double apostrophe (!) for Polish quotation marks
#       (`,,foo bar baz''` over something like `"foo bar baz"` simplified the
#       implementation).
