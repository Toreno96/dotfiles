# Inserts an entry (represented by the ENTRY_FILE) into a journal (represented by
# the JOURNAL_FILE).

# The journal is edited in-place, saving backup with the dynamically generated
# extension based on the current time, in the format of \`.${DATETIME_FORMAT}\`
# (see the conversion specifications described in the strftime(3) manual page),
# e.g. \`journal.md\` -> \`journal.md.${DATETIME_NOW}\`.
